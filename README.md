# bLockerman's Minesweeper autosolver

quite simple autosolver script tested on xeno & delta (works on both)

have in mind that script is heavily rage mode based, legit just exist and makes alot of mistakes (use another script for that, i left it in a file called legit-autosolver)

features:

rage mode
status - shows current status of the script and acts as a turn on button

toggle freeze (basically locks your character in place so you can't misstep on a mine)
toggle auto guess (automatically tries to predict where the mine could be if there is no solvation)
action delay (tp cooldown, self explanatory)
spawn delay (changes the time script would wait after you die in any way)

legit mode
status - same thing as in rage

auto flag (flags mines in range, kinda buggy)
calculate delay (amount of time before the script would calculate again)
flag range

event

collect presents - automatically collects presents if they spawn
